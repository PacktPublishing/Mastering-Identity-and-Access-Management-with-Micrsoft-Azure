#Mastering Identity and Access Management with Microsoft Azure


This is the code repository for [Mastering Identity and Access Management with Microsoft Azure](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-identity-and-access-management-microsoft-azure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785889448), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

The codes of this book are being revised and will be uploaded soon.


##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
"use strict";
//---- Start custom code ----
function loadJquery(callback) {
var jqueryScript = document.createElement('script');
jqueryScript.setAttribute('src',
'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js');
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jqueryScript);
```

To use the book efficiently, you should have some understanding of security solutions,
Active Directory, access privileges/rights, and authentication methods. Programming
knowledge is not required but will be helpful for using PowerShell or working with APIs to
customize your solutions.
